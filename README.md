![example][https://github.com/sergiks/canvas-text-arc/raw/master/example.png]

Quick experiment in rendering a text geometry distortion effect within canvas.

Text line is created in SVG, then copied to canvas and mapped to another plane with some polar distortion.

TODO: interpolate border pixels of the bent area.
